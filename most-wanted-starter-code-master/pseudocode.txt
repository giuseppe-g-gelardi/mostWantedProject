// User stories:
1, //(5 points): As a developer, I want to make at least 15 consistent commits with good, descriptive messages.

2, //(5 points): As a developer, I want to run validation on any user input, ensuring that a user is re-prompted when they provide invalid input.

  // write a function with two parameters
  // param 1, string to display to user prompting them for a choice
  // param 2, array of valid choices

  // prompt user using string and valid choices
  // if invalid reprompt
  // otherwise if valid return choice


const func = (promptStr, choiceArr) => {
  response = prompt(promptStr, + "your choices are: " + choiceArr)
  validChoice = false;
  for (looooooop) {
    prompt choiceArr[i];
    validChoice = true;
  }
  if true
  return
}

3, //(10 points): As a user, I want to be able to search for someone based on a single criterion

  // write a function with one parameter
  // iterate through the data and search for attributes based on userInput criteria
  // return firstname and last name that/those people

  const func = (criteria) => {
    userinput = prompt('what search criteria?')
    newPersonVariable = []
    // iterate through data {
      // if found (data === userinput), 
      // push firstname and last name into newPersonVariable Array
    //}
    return newPersonVariable
  }


4,//(20 points): As a user, I want to be able to search for someone based on multiple traits (up to a maximum of five criteria at once). 
  // i.e., if you search for Gender: male and Eye Color: blue, you should get back a list of people who match the search. In this case, it will be only people who are male with blue eyes.

    // get & display full data set
    // Search on user's first request using chosen filter 
    // Display results
    // Request for additional filters
    // Search subset of data with additional filter
    // Display results
    // Repeat until user is satisfied or choose to display individual info



5, //(15 points): As a user, I want to be able to look up someone’s information after I find them with the program (display values for the various traits of the found person).

  // prompt user: is this the person youre looking for? yes : no
  // if no, keep searching
  // if yes alert()
    // use tring interpolation to describe the person && display the object for reference.

6, //(25 points): As a user, after locating a person, I want to see only that person’s descendants (display the names of the descendants), using recursion.

  //  functionThatDoesThings(functionThatDoesThings(functionThatDoesThings(functionThatDoesThings(functionThatDoesThings(help))))) lulz

7, //(20 points): As a user, after locating a person, I want to see only that person’s immediate family members, displaying the names of the family members and their relation to the found person.  

  // after person is selected cross reference parents ID#'s
  // location any other Person with the same parent ID#'s
  // display each person and their relationship to the origianlly searched person as well as the spouse
